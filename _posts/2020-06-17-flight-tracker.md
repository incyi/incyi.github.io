title:  "Flight tracker"
---

Flightradar24 gives a business account to everyone who shares flight data. And you can build a tracker with a Raspberry Pi and a RTL SDR. My ground station is called: T-EHAM522

It's possible to use 1 radio to feed multiple services. So I can later add https://flightaware.com and https://planefinder.net. But first I need to mount everything outside.
